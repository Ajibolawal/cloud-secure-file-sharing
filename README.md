# ‚òÅÔ∏è Secure Cloud File Sharing ‚òÅÔ∏è

This project is all about providing a secure way to share files using cloud technology. It's built with Node.js and Azure, and it lets you upload, download, and share files using links that only work for a limited time. We use Azure Blob Storage to keep your files safe, and we've set up a system to automatically delete files after 24 hours to help with security and keep things tidy. This project demonstrates a secure cloud-based file-sharing application with a focus on secure file handling and access control.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Secure File Uploading: Makes it easy and safe for users to upload their files.
- Time-Sensitive Download Links (Security Feature): Generates ephemeral download links that expire after 24 hours. This is a security feature designed to limit exposure and control access to shared files.
- Azure Blob Storage for Scalable and Secure Storage: Uses Azure Blob Storage to provide a reliable and scalable place to store your files in the cloud.
- Automatic File Tidying (Automated Security Measure): We've set up Azure Storage to automatically delete files after 24 hours. This is an automated security measure to reduce the risk of data breaches from old files and helps to manage storage effectively.
- Running on Azure Web Apps: The application is hosted on Azure Web Apps, so it's accessible and can handle plenty of users.
- Automated Deployment with GitHub Actions: We use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the application, making sure it's done smoothly and reliably.
- Using Environment Variables: The application uses environment variables for its settings, which is a good way to keep sensitive information out of the code itself.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment and Configuration

### 1. Create a Storage Account in Azure
- In the Azure portal, create a new storage account.
        ![Screenshot of creating a storage account](images/001.png)
- Once deployed, navigate to the storage account.

- If you encounter an error, you may need to install dependencies. For example, if you get an error related to Express, run: `npm install express`

    ![Screenshot of installing dependencies](images/007.png)

- Continue running `node app.js` until you see a message indicating the server is running on a specific port - similar to the first screenshot.

### 6. Testing Locally
- Open the application in your web browser and use the file upload functionality:
    - Choose a file ‚Üí Select "Open" ‚Üí Click "Upload".
            ![Screenshot of clicking Upload](images/009.png)
    - Upon successful upload, you will see a "File uploaded successfully!" message.
        ![Screenshot of File uploaded successfully message](images/010.png)

 - You will also be provided with:
    - An option to download the file.
    - An option to copy the download link.

### 7. Verifying Uploads in Azure
- In the Azure portal, navigate to your storage account.
- Go to "Storage browser" ‚Üí "Blob containers" ‚Üí "uploads".

### 8. Configure Lifecycle Management
- In the Azure portal, navigate to "Data management" -> "Lifecycle management" in your storage account.
    - Create a name for the rule, such as 'Delete files after 1 day', and select 'Limit blobs with filters' as the rule scope.
        ![Screenshot of creating a lifecycle rule](images/012.png)
    - Add the condition: if the base blobs were created more than a day ago, then the blob will be deleted.
        ![Screenshot of adding the lifecycle condition](images/013.png)
    - Add a filter set with the blob prefix as `uploads/` to ensure that only items within this specific container are deleted.
        ![Screenshot of adding the filter set](images/014.png)
    - Ensure the rule is enabled.
        ![Screenshot of enabling the lifecycle rule](images/015.png)

    - Select your resource group.
    - Provide a name for your web app.
    - Choose the runtime stack (e.g., Node 20 LTS).
    - Select the appropriate region and pricing plan.
    - Click "Review + create" and then "Create".

        ![Screenshot of clicking Apply and then Confirm](images/026.png)

### 16. Secure Environment Variable Handling (Security Hardening Recommendation)
- To enhance security hardening, it's strongly recommended to manage sensitive information, such as API keys and connection strings, securely. While not used in this project, Azure Key Vault is a best practice for this purpose.

- Key Vault offers significant advantages:
    - **Centralised Secret Management:** Consolidates application secrets into a single, managed, and secure repository.
    - **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Enables precise control over who or what can access stored secrets, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
    - **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Provides detailed logs of secret access, facilitating security monitoring and compliance. 
    - **Mitigation of Accidental Exposure:** Significantly reduces the risk of inadvertently exposing sensitive information in code, configuration files, or logging systems.
- While not implemented here, Azure Key Vault is a critical security best practice for protecting sensitive credentials in a production cloud environment.

### 17. Verification
- Azure is now successfully hosting the web app.
- Files can be uploaded successfully.
        ![Screenshot of files uploaded successfully](images/027.png)

- The website has been sent out to people for testing, and these are the results in the storage: Verify that uploaded files appear in your storage account: "Storage Account Overview" ‚Üí "Storage browser" ‚Üí "Blob containers" ‚Üí "uploads".
